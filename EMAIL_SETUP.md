# Email Setup Guide (Gmail)

To send emails after form submission, you need to configure Gmail with an **App Password**.

## Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Click on "2-Step Verification"
3. Follow the steps to enable it (if not already enabled)
4. You'll need your phone for verification

## Step 2: Create App Password

1. Go back to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Click on "2-Step Verification" again
3. Scroll down to find "App passwords" (at the bottom)
4. Click on "App passwords"
5. You might need to sign in again
6. Select:
   - App: **Mail**
   - Device: **Other (Custom name)**
   - Type: "Aayush Tracker"
7. Click "Generate"
8. **Copy the 16-character password** (looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

## Step 3: Update .env File

Open your `.env` file and add:

```
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password
```

**Example:**
```
EMAIL_USER=abhaykaul224@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Use the App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password!

npm start
```
